# Personal-Portfolio-Website
Created a personal portolio using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are five sections: home, about, services, portfolio, and contact. The nav bar scrolls to the section corresponding to the header when clicked. Used Javascript for the tab feature within the "About Me" section to alternate between the tabs. The services and portfolio page utilize a grid format with hyperlinks to my projects and work on Github. The contact section has hyperlinks to my social media pages, a button to download my resume, and a form to reach out that is stored on a Google Sheets I created. After creating the initial webpage, I am working on converting it to React.js
